### Bear in mind

For a few weeks these two quotes still are on my mind:

## 1. If it hurts, do it more often

I read this article again about two months ago and it came to my mind again now - as I started to work on CI/CD for our main project on AzureDevOps. We should do this months ago :)

## 2. Make it work, do it better, make it perfect.

Source: I didn't find real source, that's just first link from Google https://medium.com/@sarahscode/make-it-work-then-make-it-better-de8b0e5e3d02

Why does it important for me? Excessive perfection can stop you from even starting :)
