First one on path `Becaming Scala Engineer` - diving in Scala world

## To start with - materials

## Obvious things
Yes, you can learn anything for your inner joy and self-development. But let's be honest - best opportunity is to learn and experience in your job, on large scale application so you can be sure that your choices, your architecture is battle-tested.

## Online courses
There is this guy on Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/user/daniel-ciocirlan/. He has published several courses on Scala and Akka, I think that's good start, especially with Scala.

The next question is why you are interested in Scala programming? For me, after short recon, it is the gate to functional programming. Till now I was learning and improving my OOP knowledge, which (I hope) I'm quite good. But Scala is well-known as `better Java` allowing to and encouraging to mix (not sure if this is good verb here...) OOP and FP as well. So... that's my motivation, and next steps I want to make:
