## How deal with new task

Taken from Twitter conversation: https://mobile.twitter.com/edo/status/1552551543915831299

1. Don't jump to solutions - take the time to build a deep shared understanding of the problem space, before thinking about solutions. Pause, because great solutions come from a great understanding of the context.
2. Useful questions:
 - What is the problem?
 - Who has the problem?
 - Why is it important to solve this now for the business/users?
 - When do we know we are succesful?
 - What are we not trying to solve or build - non-goals / out of scope

Success: How do we know if weâ€™ve solved this problem?
Audience: Who are we building for?
What: Roughly, what does this look like in the product?
How: What is the experiment plan?
When: When does it ship and what are the milestones?
