### Old way

I used not to care about how I connect via ssh - as it seemed too trivial operation. But I was wrong! Do you also want one-liner to connect?

## New  way - source

Almost all is described here: https://linuxize.com/post/using-the-ssh-config-file/. Managing your `config` file makes it truely `trivial` to create connections.

## SSH keys

Tired of writing password each time? You can generate ssh keys. Well described here: https://www.ssh.com/ssh/key/

Short instruction:
#### Client side
Generate keys:

``` ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<some comment>" ```

Copy generated pub file content.

In `config` file add line:
``` IdentifyFile /absolute_path/to/generated_file ```

#### Server side

Add in **new line** in file `authorized_keys` (somewhere on path ~/.ssh aka /home/your_user/.ssh) copied content.
